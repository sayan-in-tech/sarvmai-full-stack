1,103
2,101
3,120
4,102
```

## 🧠 Boarding Logic & Constraints

- Passengers board from the front (row A is closest).
- For bookings with multiple seats, the closest row is used.
- If two bookings are in the same row, the lower Booking_ID boards first.
- Bookings with empty seat lists are skipped (with a warning).

### Boarding Logic Illustration

```
+-----------------------------+
|        Bus Layout          |
+-----------+-----------+----+
| A20 / B20 |           | C20 / D20 |
|-----------+-----------+-----------|
|                                   |
|                                   |
|           X                       |
|           Y        <- If X is standing, Y can't cross
|                                   |
|                                   |
|                                   |
|                                   |
| A1  / B1  |           | C1  / D1  |
|-----------+-----------+-----------|
|           Entry (Front)          |
+-----------------------------+
```

**Explanation:**
- The bus is entered from the front (bottom of the diagram).
- Rows are labeled A, B, C, D from left to right, and numbered from 1 (front) to 20 (back).
- Passengers with seats closer to the front (lower row letters, lower numbers) should board first.
- If a passenger (X) is standing in the aisle, another passenger (Y) behind cannot cross until X is seated.
- The boarding sequence is designed to minimize aisle congestion and allow smooth boarding from front to back.
- For bookings with multiple seats, the seat closest to the front determines the boarding order for that booking.
- If two bookings are in the same row, the one with the lower Booking_ID boards first.
- Bookings with empty seat lists are skipped (with a warning).

## Render Deployment Notes

- Make sure `gunicorn` is in your requirements.txt (already added).
- Set your Render start command to:

```
gunicorn bus_boarding.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

This ensures your Django app binds to the correct port and uses a production-ready WSGI server.
